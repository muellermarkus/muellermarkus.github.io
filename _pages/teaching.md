I have gained substantial teaching experience as a TA in statistics and machine learning at both the undergraduate and postgraduate level. I also supervised many undergraduate and postgraduate students on their theses.


#### Erasmus University Rotterdam (postgraduate)
For these courses, my TA work typically involved the creation / grading of assignments and exams.
- Machine Learning
- Machine Learning in Finance
- Machine Learning and Economics
- Data Science in Context
  
#### Erasmus University Rotterdam (undergraduate)
For these courses, my TA work involved grading weekly assignments and group presentations.
- Machine Learning Seminar
- Academic Writing

#### Tinbergen Institute / BDS (research master)
For these courses, my TA work consisted of guiding students through exercise material of both practical (programming) and theoretical nature.
- Statistics 
- Supervised Machine Learning
- Unsupervised Machine Learning

#### University of Potsdam
For these courses, my TA work mostly focused on guiding students through exercise material. This includes both computer lab exercises for programming as well as theoretical exercises. Part of my teaching was done via videos during COVID.
- Machine Learning and Economics 
- Statistics (undergraduate)
- Advanced Microeconometrics
- Applied Public Policy Evaluation 

#### Thesis supervision
See below for a broad overview of the supervised topics:

- Denoising Autoencoders for tabular data
- Classification and Regression Diffusion models
- Post-hoc auditing of synthetic tabular data
- Deep Learning for tabular data
- VAEs for ITE estimation under confounding
