I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics) at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en), supervised by [Dennis Fok](https://www.eur.nl/people/dennis-fok) and [Kathrin Gruber](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/kathrin-gruber). My work focuses on deep generative models for tabular data, in particular on diffusion models and flow matching. Besides that, I am also interested in probabilistic machine learning (uncertainty quantification and variational inference) and general deep learning for tabular data.

Previously, I completed the research master in [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/home) at the Tinbergen Institute / BDS in Amsterdam.
