I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Econometric Institute](https://www.eur.nl/en/ese/department-econometrics) at [Erasmus University Rotterdam](https://www.eur.nl/en), supervised by [Dennis Fok](https://www.eur.nl/people/dennis-fok) and [Kathrin Gruber](https://www.eur.nl/en/people/kathrin-gruber). My research focuses on deep generative models for tabular data, with a particular emphasis on diffusion models and flow matching. I aim to develop methods that generate high-quality data efficiently, making them practically relevant for real-world applications. More broadly, I am interested in probabilistic machine learning (including uncertainty quantification and variational inference) as well as deep learning for structured data.

Before starting my Ph.D., I completed the Research Master in [Business Data Science](https://businessdatascience.nl/home) at the Tinbergen Institute / BDS in Amsterdam. My academic background is rooted in Econometrics and Economics, with a strong focus on causal inference. This foundation enables me to approach modeling problems from both theoretical and applied perspectives.
